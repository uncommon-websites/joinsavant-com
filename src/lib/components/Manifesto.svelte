        silicon valley is in a crisis of bad quests. with no shortage of talent, capital, or urgent problems, our best builders are chasing safe bets, derivative saas, or early retirement.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        at savant, we exist for the few who choose otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        we back exceptional founders taking on civilization-defining problems at the earliest stage, with a focus on <strong class="font-semibold text-black">robotics, space, defense and agi infrastructure</strong>. these quests are hard – they're operationally complex, capital-intensive, and technically near-impossible. but they're the only quests that matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        if you're the kind of person who didn't come here to play it safe. you came to push humanity forward. we built this for you. this is your arena. we'll give you the <strong class="font-semibold text-black">capital, networks & media firepower</strong> to build faster than anywhere else.
